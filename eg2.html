        <h2>BIOCHEMISTRY</h2>
        <p>Chemistry of life is the basis of all Life Sciences. The Biochemistry programme was started in the year 1997.The undergraduate programme in Biochemistry includes well established laboratories as well as emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that would concurrently provide global opportunities of learning for the younger generation. To improve the students learning experience in biochemistry and biological sciences and to make their learning meaningful, the laboratories of degree and diploma courses are equipped with basic and sophisticated instruments to experience hands on training, diagnostic instruments for revealing student thinking, research based instruments to measure students conceptual understanding and aseptic technical training to deal with the emerging trends and challenge in the biological sciences education. Students of this department annually visit various Departmental laboratories such as Biochemistry, Molecular biology, Bioinformatics & Biotechnology of Pondicherry University as a study tour. Every year we celebrate ‘National Science Day’ as an enrichment Programme where students are formally trained to present models, PowerPoint Presentations, Posters, conduct debate and Quiz. Every Academic year experts from the scientific field are invited to deliver special lectures to the students.</p>
